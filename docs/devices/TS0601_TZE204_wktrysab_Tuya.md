## Notes
The Tuya TS0601 8-Way Switch provides control for up to eight individual switch channels. Each switch can be monitored and toggled independently, making it a versatile option for multi-point control in smart home setups.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `onEvent`: Synchronizes the switch's internal clock with the Zigbee network.
* `configure`: Sends a "magic packet" to configure the device on initial setup.

## Exposes

### Switch (binary) for each endpoint
Each of the 8 switches (`l1` to `l8`) can be toggled independently.  
Each switch's status is represented as a binary value and can be found in the published state with properties:
- `state_l1`, `state_l2`, ..., `state_l8`

**Values**:  
- `true` - Switch ON  
- `false` - Switch OFF

It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) these values individually, but each switch can be toggled via the respective endpoint.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Signal quality indicator of the Zigbee connection for the device.

- **Range**: `0` (minimum) to `255` (maximum)
- **Unit**: `lqi`
